## About Sumé LMS

> Note: This repository contains the **course microservice** of the Sumé LMS. If you are looking for more information
> about the application, we strongly recommend you to [check the documentation](https://www.sumelms.com/docs).

and scalability to your learning environment.

- Compatible with SCORM and xAPI (TinCan)
- Flexible and modular
- Open-source and Free
- Fast and modern
- Easy to install and run
- Designed for microservices
- REST API based application
- and more.

## Prerequisites

- Go >= 1.19
- PostgreSQL >= 9.5 (with `uuid-ossp` extension)

## Prepare

Clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:sumelms/microservice-course.git
```

Access the project folder, and download the Go dependencies

```bash
$ go get ./...
```

It may take a while to download all the dependencies, then you are [ready to build](#building).

## Building

There are two ways that you can use to build this microservice. The first one will build it using your own machine,
while the second one will build it using a container runtime. Also, you can build the container image to use it with
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/), but it is up to you.

Here are the following instructions for each available option:

### Local build

It should be pretty simple, once all the dependencies are download just run the following command:

```bash
$ make build
```

It will generate an executable file at the `/bin` directory inside the project folder, and probably you want to know how to [run it](#running).

### Container build

At this point, I'll assume that you have installed and configure the container runtime (Docker or Podman) in your system.

```bash
$ make container-build
```

If everything works, you can now [run the microservice using the container image](#running).

### Local database

You can have your local database running the following command:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d postgres
```

And then you could run the migrations using 

```bash
$ make migrations-up
```

> *Note*
> You will have to install the [golang-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) tool
> It uses the same environment variables from the configuration section.

## Running

OK! Now you build it you need to run the microservice. That should also be pretty easy.

### Local run

If you want to run the microservice locally, you may need to have a **Postgres** instance running and accessible
from your machine, and you may need to first [configure it](#configuring). Then you can run it, you just need to
execute the following command:

```bash
$ make run
```

Once it is running you can test it: http://localhost:8080/health

### Container run

If you want to run the microservice using a container runtime, the easiest way to do it is using the `docker-composer` or `podman-compose`.

All that you need to do is, execute the command:

```bash
$ make compose-up
```

It should create 2 containers, one that runs the microservice and another that runs the **Postgres**. If you already have your own **Postgres** instance you can only run the microservice container:

```bash
$ make container-run
```

Keep in mind that, in both cases, it will load the `config/config.yml` file from the project. If you want to change some
configurations you can set the environment variables in your `docker-compose.yml` file, or edit the configuration file.

Once you have the IP address you can now access the endpoint: http://localhost:8080/health

## Configuring

You can easily configure the application editing the `config/config.yml` file or using environment variables. We do
strongly recommend that you use the configuration file instead of the environment variables. Again, it is up to you
to decide. If you want to use the variables, be sure to prefix it all with `SUMELMS_`.

The list of the environment variables and it's default values:

```bash
SUMELMS_SERVER_HTTP_PORT = 8080
SUMELMS_DATABASE_DRIVER = postgres
SUMELMS_DATABASE_HOST = localhost
SUMELMS_DATABASE_PORT = 5432
SUMELMS_DATABASE_USER = nil
SUMELMS_DATABASE_PASSWORD = nil
SUMELMS_DATABASE_DATABASE = sumelms_course
```

> We are using [configuro](https://github.com/sherifabdlnaby/configuro) to manage the configuration, so the precedence
> order to configuration is: _Environment variables > .env > Config File > Value set in Struct before loading._

## Testing

You can run all the tests with one single command:

```bash
$ make test
```

## Documentation

The complete Sumé LMS documentation can be found in our [official website](https://sumelms.com/docs).

### API

This project uses [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) to generate the API documentation and API mockup, the files can be found  `swagger` directory. 

Sometimes, a microservice can cover more than one domain boundary, in this case, the API scheme should be stored in the same directory indicated above, but following the following filename convention: `<domain-name>-api.yaml`

The best way to edit the API scheme is by using the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/).
